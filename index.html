    <section><p class="one">Artificial intelligence(AI) is a <b>technology</b> that enables machines to perform tasks that normally require human intelligence-such as learning,reasoning,problem-solving,andunderstanding language.</p>
    <h2>Key AI Concepts</h2>
    <p>1.Machine Learning:A subset of AI that focuses on buliding systems that can learn from data.The more data an AI system is exposed to,the better it becomes at its task.</p>
    <p>2.Neural Networks:A type of machine learning model inspired by the human brain,capable of recognizing complex patterns in data.</p>
    <p>3.Deep Learning:A more advanced form of machine learning that uses deep neural networks with many layers to process complex data like images and speech.</p>
    <h2>Examples of AI Applications</h2>
    <p>Personalized recommendations:AI algorithms recommend movies,products,and music based on user behavior.</p>
    <p>Virtual assistants:AI-powered assistants like Siri and Alexa understand and respond to voice commands.</p>
    <p>Medical diagnosis:AI can analyze medical images like X-rays and MRIs to help doctors detect diseases faster and more accurately.</p>
    <P>Autonomous vehicles:AI is crucial for self-driving cars,enabling them perceive to their environment and make decisions in real-time</P>
    <p>Financial services:AI is used for fraud detection,algorithmic trading,and personalized financial advice.</p>
    <h2>The role of AI in various fields</h2>
    <p>Science and research:AI can analyze vast datasets to accelerate scientific discovery inn fields like genomics and climate science.</p>
    <p>Customer service:AI-powered chatbots can handle customer inquiries,providing instant support.Manufacturing AI can optimize production processes,predict equipment failure,and improve quality control.</p>
    <p>Creativity:AI is being used to generate art,music,and text,although these are still developing areas.</p>

</center>
   
    <p>refers to artificial intelligence system that are designed and trained to perform a specific task or a limited range of tasks.They operate under a fixed set of rules and cannot think or act beyond what they are programmed for.</p>
    <h1>Examples of Narrow AI</h1>
    <ul>
        <li><h2>Siri or Alexa</h2>Voice assitants that can answer question or set remainders.</li>
        <li><h2>Google Search</h2>Finds information based on your query.</li>
        <li><h2>Face Recognition</h2>Identifies people in photos.</li>
        <li><h2>Chatsbots</h2>Respond to specific customer service questions.</li>
    </ul>
    <h1>Key Features</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>Focused on one domain or task.</li>
        <li>Cannot learn or adapt beyond programmed functions.</li>
